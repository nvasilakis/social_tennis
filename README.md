#Social Tennis App

This is an effort to merge all local ladders in to one national ladder. Each
player will have the ability to register in the Social Tennis and challenge any
player in a national level (of course given that she follows the ladder rules).
The locality (residence), statistic, performance, home tennis club and many
other essential information of each player will be known to anyone upon
registration. However, some more private information will be only known to
friends or selected friends.

It can be seen as an unofficial fork of the ATP/WTA sites with stats of each
player etc, but only for amateurs and semi-professional players will be
featured (pro players wouldn't have enough time to participate anyway).


# TODO
1. add basic static pages (Home/About/Contact)
2. Add basic users infastructure
3. Add advanced user profile
4. Add messaging infastructure. It can be used, virtually, for all user-user
interactions.
5. Add user Wall that is part of the incoming/outgoing messages
6. ....
