# Social Tennis App

This is an effort to merge all local ladders in to one national ladder. Each player will have the ability to register in the Social Tennis and challenge any player in a national level. The locality (residence), favourite tennis club and many other essential information of each player will be known to anyone upon registration. However, some more private information will be only known to friends or selected friends.

It can be seen as an unofficial fork of the ATP/WTA sites with stats of each player etc, but only for amateurs and semi-professional players will be featured (pro players would'nt have enough time to participate anyway).
